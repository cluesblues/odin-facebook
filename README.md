#Odin-Facebook App
Final project for the Ruby on Rails course on http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails.

In this project we build a facebook clone app, allowing users to create posts, write comments, like other user's posts and send and receive friend requests. We also allow users to sign in using their facebook account.

More information and full scope of the project can be found at: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails
